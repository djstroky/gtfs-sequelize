    Frequencies are used when a line does not have set arrival and departure times,
    but instead services run with a set interval. Frequencies are defined in the
    file frequencies.txt, and are associated with a Trip definition. It is intended
    to represent schedules that don't have a fixed list of stop times.

    When trips are defined in frequencies.txt, the trip planner ignores the absolute
    values of the arrival_time and departure_time fields for those trips in
    stop_times.txt. Instead, the stop_times table defines the sequence of stops and
    the time difference between each stop.

      to end_time, no trip must be scheduled.
