      Specifies the arrival time at a specific stop for a specific trip on a route. The time
      is measured from "noon minus 12h" (effectively midnight, except for days on which daylight
      savings time changes occur) at the beginning of the service date. For times occurring
      after midnight on the service date, enter the time as a value greater than 24:00:00 in
      HH:MM:SS local time for the day on which the trip schedule begins. If you don't have
      separate times for arrival and departure at a stop, enter the same value for arrival_time
      and departure_time.

      If this stop isn't a time point, use an empty string value for the arrival_time and
      departure_time fields. Stops without arrival times will be scheduled based on the nearest
      preceding timed stop. To ensure accurate routing, please provide arrival and departure
      times for all stops that are time points. Do not interpolate stops.

      You must specify arrival and departure times for the first and last stops in a trip.

      Times must be eight digits in HH:MM:SS format (H:MM:SS is also accepted, if the hour begins
      with 0). Do not pad times with spaces. The following columns list stop times for a trip and
      the proper way to express those times in the arrival_time field:

      Time            arrival_time value
      08:10:00 A.M.   08:10:00 or 8:10:00

      01:55:00 A.M.   25:55:00
      NOTE: Trips that span multiple dates will have stop times greater than 24:00:00. For example,
      if a trip begins at 10:30:00 p.m. and ends at 2:15:00 a.m. on the following day, the stop
      times would be 22:30:00 and 26:15:00. Entering those stop times as 22:30:00 and 02:15:00
